  <h2> The Blaa </h2>
  <p>
   Don't leave Waterford City without trying out the world famous 'Blaa', a floury bread product exclusive to Waterford City eaten mainly at breakfast time. <br> Its introduction to Waterford City has been credited to the French Huguenots who settled in Waterford City in 1693.  They brought pain blanc to Waterford which was corrupted by Waterfordians to blaa.<br>  Locals enjoy their blaa with a 'rasher' of bacon or some 'Red Lead' (luncheon sausage) in the middle as a mid morning snack. Other popular fillers include cheese and onion crisps and sliced ham, which the locals pronounce "hang".
