          <h2> Traditional Pubs </h2>
          <p>
            If you just want to relax and enjoy the atmosphere in a pub with character, there are a number of excellent pubs scattered around the City which you should check out.<br> Ideally located beside Reginald's Tower is The Reg, which offers entertainment 7 nights a week. <br> Another option is Downes on Thomas Street, which was established in 1759 and is still in the same eccentric family for six generations. It is also one of the few remaining houses to bottle its own whiskey.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
           Located down the narrow streets of Waterford City's historic quarter, The Munster Bar was established as a public house in 1822 and has been in the hands of the Fitzgerald family since 1952. The interior has beautiful oak panelled walls and elegant fireplaces. <br>Other traditional pubs also well worth a visit include Geoffs Bar, The Gingerman, Katty Barrys, Jordans and the Three Shippes which are in the City Centre and within easy walking distance of each other.

    <h2> Waterford Art Gallery</h2>
    <p>
     Housed in the former Methodist church at Greyfriars, the Waterford Municipal Art Gallery is the home of the Waterford Art Collection, one of the oldest and best municipal collections of art in Ireland. Among the 200 works of Irish painting and Irish sculpture it contains, are works by the renowned expressionist Jack B Yeats, the landscape and portrait painter Charles Lamb and possibly the greatest twentieth century Irish artist - Louis Le Brocquy.<br>

     Unfortunately, neither the Waterford County Council nor the Waterford Municipal Art Gallery seems to provide online information about the Gallery's opening hours, or permanent collection, so for further information please phone: 051-860-856; or write to: Waterford Municipal Art Gallery, Greyfriars, Waterford.<br>
   </p>
   <p>
     The Pauline Bewick Collection in the the Walton Building of the Waterford Institute of Technology contains 240 artworks by Irish artist Pauline Bewick, a descendant of the nineteenth century painter Thomas Bewick. Immensely prolific as an artist, Pauline Bewick is primarily associated with watercolour painting, although she also produces oils, sculpture, and tapestries. In 2006, she generously donated over 200 artworks to the Irish state, including tapestries, wall hangings, watercolours and sketches. These artworks are on display both here in Waterford and in the Killorglin Library, Co. Kerry.<br>
