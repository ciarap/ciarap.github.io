         <li>Cuan-na-Grian:  The ancient Celtic name for Waterford was “Cuan na Graí” or “The Harbour of the Sun”. If you’ve ever travelled up the river at dawn, you’ll understand this one. It is the most beautiful sight in the world, bar none.</li>

         <li>Vadre Fjord: Waterford, known as Vadrefjord to its Viking founders, has a Norse history dating back to the ninth century.  Vadre Fjord means Water Ford and is where the English name comes from.</li>
