    <p> Winterval is the largest celebration of the festive season in Ireland and this year offers families a trail of over 30 different events and activities with 18 of those events on offer free of charge. Expect all the firm family favourites such as the Singing Christmas Tree, Horse Drawn Victorian Sleigh, the free Toy Museum this year featuring a 'Star Wars' and 'Transformers' theme and Viking settlement. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There will also be some brand new exciting attractions including an exhibit from the National Reptile Zoo, a vintage fair at the oldest trading post in Ireland on Ballybricken Green, an Ice-Slide in the City, a Winter Wonderland Garden designed by Bloom gold-medal winner Gerard Mullen, a special production of 'Bad Santa' and a living Crib. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Other new attractions also include a fantastic new Winterval Illuminates, a 3d light show projected onto the front of the Old Deanery building in Palace Square. Don't miss the all new Santa Experience - an exciting journey through the enchanting North Pole at the award winning Medieval Museum. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the way you will explore the enchanted garden, climb aboard the Polar Express Train, seek out all the little critters hard at work, ramble through the elves' living quarters, jump in to the bunk beds and wander around little houses before popping in to see Santa Claus. Give him your wish list, receive a lovely gift and have your photo taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      If that's not enough for you, why not experience the home of Waterford's very own Grinch, this year's Bad Santa? Located in the refurbished Ballybricken bandstand, this landmark gets an iconic transformation into the home of the nefarious holiday villain.
