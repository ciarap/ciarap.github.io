      <h2>Medieval Museum:<br>Treasures of Medieval Waterford </h2>
      <p> Currently ranked as the number one visitor attraction in Waterford on tripadvisor.com, the Medieval Museum is situated between Cathedral Square and the Bishop's Palace in the heart of the Viking Triangle.<br>
       The medieval museum incorporates the 13th century Choristers' Hall and a 15th century wine vault and takes visitors back to the great age of faith and chivalry. This multi-award winning museum is a tribute to medieval life in Waterford.<br>
       The museum galleries feature some of the great treasures of medieval Ireland and Europe, including the unique 4 metre long illuminated Great Charter Roll of Waterford (1373) as well as the sumptuous cloth-of-gold vestments (1460).<br>
       The Medieval Museum was officially opened on Thursday 28th March 2013 by An Taoiseach (Prime Minister of Ireland) Enda Kenny.<br>
